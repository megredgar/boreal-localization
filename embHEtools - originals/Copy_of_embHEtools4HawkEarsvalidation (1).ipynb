        "# What is HawkEars?\n",
        "\n",
        "HawkEars is an audio species recognizer built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Canadian birds (primarily). Other sounds like amphibians and squirrels are recognized and labelled but were not trained to the same level as birds. Using spectrograms created from audio files, it searches for patterns of sound that match a particular species and provides labels. HawkEars uses a moving window to go across the spectrogram in a 3 second long window (you control overlap of that window but not window size). Platt scaling is then used to compute a score in each window where based on the degree to which the audio signal match what the CNN knows, you decide if it was or was not the species of interest. Jan Huus created and managed HawkEars."
